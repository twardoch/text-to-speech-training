## “An Ordinary Day”

It was a typical day and a woman needed help getting back to her feet. A young girl was asked for assistance, but she gave no clear response. The term had ended in late June that year, and the bill was paid every third week.

The man of the house was tasked to type out three lists of orders. However, the harder he tried the less he got done. He struggled with simple math, trying to calculate that two plus seven is less than ten. He was asked to guess the result from the first scores but found it difficult. The instructions were clear, "drop the two when you add the figures."

Sunday was considered the best part of the week by some, but for others, it was just another day. People wondered where they were when the noise started. A reminder was given to write at once or they may forget it. The play began as soon as they sat down.

There were men who walked the middle of the road, who played it safe and didn't take risks. Both brothers wear the same size, but their personalities couldn't be more different. In some form or other, they all agreed that they need fun in their lives. The collective sentiment was that one war is enough and time brings many changes.

Women formed less than half of the group, but their voices were just as important. Most of the news was easy for them to hear, but some stories were harder to digest. Next Tuesday, they were reminded, they must vote.
