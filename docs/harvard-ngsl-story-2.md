## “A Day Full of Surprises”

It was just a typical day... or so it seemed. But little did a woman know that she would need help getting back on her feet! It took a LOT of effort — but with the help of her friends, she finally made it up. They laughed and joked, telling her to “go now, and come back later.”

But... the fun wasn’t over yet! Oh, no! As they played a game, the woman made a move that signaled the end of the game. They all cheered “HOORAY!!!”, knowing that their victory was well-deserved. Hah hah hah... One of them wrote down a long list of items, documenting their win for posterity.

So, what did they do next? Good that you ask! They settled down and discussed the game. Then, suddenly, they realized that much of their story made good sense. They agreed that “to HAVE is better than to WAIT, and HOPE.” The music played on in the background, adding to the lively atmosphere.

However, they all knew that they needed to bring this joyous occasion to an end. “We need an end to all such matters,” they said in unison. Despite not making much money, they had a great time together, so they all agreed that the best way to save money is to simply not spend much.

“There are many ways to have fun”, they all agreed on that! And even a JUST cause needs power to win. Those last words were a strong statement, and everyone took heed. They checked the calendar and noted that next Sunday was the twelfth of the month.

The group decided to take their kids from the public school, and set them up with a private education. ”Set the piece here and say nothing,” one of them instructed. They had to choose between the high road and the low, and they were determined to take the high road.

There was a strong chance that their joyous day would happen once more, and a six was more likely to come up than a ten. The team with the best timing always looks good, but they all knew that the facts don’t always show who is right. But what about the boy? Oh, it was done before the boy could see it, so they all breathed a sigh of relief.

They all agreed that to send their happiness in large amounts would be bad, and that the first part of the plan needed changing, because, as they say, “many hands make light work,” so they all joined in — to get the job done! They opened their books to the first page, eager to continue their journey.

Just then, the phone rang. “Will you please answer that phone,” one of them asked. And so, they continued on with their day, filled with surprises and laughter. Small children came to see them, and the woman’s name was called many times. And so, their day ended, filled with joy and memories to last a lifetime.
