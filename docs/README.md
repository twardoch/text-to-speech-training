### Harvard-NGSL sentences

- **[Harvard-NGSL sentences](harvard-ngsl-sentences)**

Kakeru Yazawa has produced a subset of 50 IEEE Harvard sentences from the full list of 720. These are phonemically balanced sentences for English learner speech corpora named the **Harvard-NGSL sentences**. These comprise core high-frequency vocabulary words for second language English learners were selected based on the New General Service List (NGSL), and are thus learner-oriented, unlike most other phoemically balanced materials which contain low-frequency and low-familiarity words that are of limited use for learners. 

Published in [Yazawa, Kakeru. (2022). Harvard-NGSL sentences for English learner speech corpora. 10.1109/O-COCOSDA202257103.2022.9998002.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365766701_Harvard-NGSL_sentences_for_English_learner_speech_corpora)


## Harvard stories

- **[Harvard-NGSL story 1](harvard-ngsl-story-1) “Life’s Challenges and Choices”**
- **[Harvard-NGSL story 2](harvard-ngsl-story-2) “A Day Full of Surprises”**
