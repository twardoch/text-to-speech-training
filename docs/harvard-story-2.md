## 2. A Day at the Circus and Beyond

Once upon a time, in a small town, there was a man who lived a simple life. His days were filled with tasks that he carried out with determination. He knew that life was hard, and men often strived to get rich, but he also knew that wealth was not always attainable.

One day, he was cutting a pie into large parts when he remembered to close the barn door tight. He lay prone and hardly moved a limb, taking a moment to rest from his daily chores. The slush lay deep along the street, but he was not discouraged by the weather. Instead, he gazed up at the sky and saw a wisp of cloud hanging in the blue air.

As he went about his day, he noticed that the cost of living had gone up. A pound of sugar now cost more than eggs. He sighed, but continued on. He walked down to the river, where he saw a fish with a fin so sharp that it cut through the clear water. The man thought about how life was like that fish, always moving forward, never looking back.

He then made his way to the town square, where a play was being performed. To his disappointment, the play seemed dull and quite stupid. He longed for something more exciting. He then remembered the boat that he had to bail out to prevent it from sinking. The term ended in late June that year, and he was happy to have finished another year of hard work.

As he walked home, he came across a man who was carving a Tusk, which would be used to make costly gifts. The man marveled at the intricate work that went into such a piece. He then saw ten pins that had been set in order, ready for a game of bowling. He smiled, remembering how much he enjoyed that pastime.

The man's life was filled with routine. Every third week, he paid his bills, and he knew that he had to be careful with his money. The strong oak trees that lined his street provided him with both strength and shade. He knew that life was like those trees, strong and steadfast, never giving up.

Cats and dogs each hated the other, and he chuckled at the thought. He then noticed that his pipe had begun to rust, even though it was brand new. He shook his head and made his way home, where he opened a crate filled with fragile glass. He was careful not to break the glass as he added the sum to the product of these three.

The man knew that thieves who robbed friends deserved to be put in jail, and he was grateful that he had never encountered such a situation in his life. He also knew that the ripe taste of cheese only improved with age, just like the lessons that life taught him. He was instructed to act on these orders with great speed, and he did so with determination.

The hog crawled under the high fence, and he marveled at the resilience of the animal. He then remembered the vat that needed to be moved over the hot fire, and he quickly got to work. The bark of the pine tree was shiny and dark, and he thought about how life was like that tree, always adapting to its surroundings.

The leaves turn brown and yellow in the fall, and he was reminded of the changing seasons. The pennant waved in the wind, and he thought about how life was like that flag, always moving forward, never looking back. He split the log with a quick, sharp blow, and then burned the peat after the logs gave out.

Finally, he sat down for dinner and ordered peach pie with ice cream. 

We had a delightful conversation about the side show at the circus. My companion suggested that I jot down my thoughts in a notebook, using a pencil as a first draft. Excited by the idea, I headed out to purchase a notebook, but only made it halfway to the hardware store. Suddenly, the clock tower rang out, marking the beginning of the third period.

As I continued my journey, I noticed a small creek cutting through a field. The snow was so heavy that cars and buses were getting stuck in drifts. I hurried inside to avoid the inclement weather and was greeted by the sound of a set of china hitting the floor and shattering. Despite the winter weather, it was still a grand season for hikes along the roads.

A dune rose up from the edge of the water as I gazed out the window. Those were the cue for an actor to take his leave. I watched as a yacht slid gracefully around a point and into the bay. I couldn't help but smile as I remembered the time I met a friend while playing on the sand.

I sat down to write and watched as the ink stain dried on the finished page. The walled town was taken without a fight and the lease would run out in sixteen weeks. A pet squirrel was running around the room, clearly well-behaved. Just then, the horn of a car blared, waking up a sleeping cop.

My heart beat strongly, with firm strokes, and I couldn't help but touch the pearl I was wearing in a thin silver ring. The fruit peel was cut into thick slices, reminding me of the Navy's attack on the big task force. I turned to see a cat glaring at a scared mouse and knew there were more than two factors at play. The hat brim was wide and droopy, much like the lawyer trying to lose his case.

The grass curled around the fence post as I walked outside.
