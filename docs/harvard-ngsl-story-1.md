## “Life’s Challenges and Choices”

It was a typical day, and a woman had fallen to the ground. A young girl was asked to help, but she gave no clear response. The term ended in late June that year, and the bill was paid every third week.

Type out three lists of orders was the next task, and the harder the person tried, the less he got done. The fact that two plus seven is less than ten was a simple arithmetic problem, but it still required attention. The task was to guess the result from the first scores, and the instruction was to drop the two when you add the figures.

Sunday was considered the best part of the week, and people wondered where they were when the noise started. The task was to write at once or risk forgetting it, and the play began as soon as they sat down.

There were men who walked the middle of the road, and both brothers wore the same size. In some form or other, fun was a necessary aspect of life. The belief was that one war was enough, and time brought many changes. Women formed less than half of the group, but most of the news was easy to hear.

The next Tuesday was the day to vote, and it took a lot of help to finish these tasks. The instruction was to go now and come back later, and that move meant the game was over. A long list of items was written down, and much of the story made good sense. To have was considered better than to wait and hope, and the music played on while they talked.

An end was needed for all such matters, and they didn't have much money, but they still had fun. The way to save money was not to spend much, and there were many ways to do these things. Even a just cause needed power to win, and those last words were a strong statement.

Next Sunday was the twelfth of the month, and they took their kids from the public school. The task was to set the piece there and say nothing, and the choice was between the high road and the low. There was a strong chance that it would happen once more, and a six came up more often than a ten. The team with the best timing looked good, but the facts didn't always show who was right.

It was done before the boy could see it, and to send it now in large amounts was considered bad. The first part of the plan needed changing, and many hands helped get the job done. The instruction was to open the book to the first page, and someone was asked to answer the phone.

Small children came to see him, and she called his name many times. It was another day filled with challenges and choices, but the journey continued.
